# PrysideAntispark
Pre Charge Antispark that fixes the issues I had with other Antispark Circuits

Have been using this Antispark in my eBike and eBoard, turned both on thousands of times.
Rated for ~150A, more than enough Amps for anything 12S and smaller than a 100Kg electric Motorcycle
Works from 6S (20V) to 12S, could also be upgraded to higher voltage, just change the fets.
I'm aware that some parts are  sometimes hard to get, f.e the mosfets, you can replace them with any other package size fets, just search on mouser etc and you'll find alternatives.
Watch out for R3, that has to be a MOX technology based resistor, other technologys can burn out!
(lower wattage R3 is not as bad as a technology that can't handle the peak current)

Specs:
6-12S max.

20-50V
400A peak
80A constant
(90°C after 10 minutes with open air T ambient 25°C)

one of my first pcb designs, 3 years old almost now, so can still have some stupid errors, feel free to correct!
